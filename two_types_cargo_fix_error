    Checking playground v0.0.1 (/home/wschroeder/Projects/playground)
warning: failed to automatically apply fixes suggested by rustc to crate `playground`

after fixes were automatically applied the compiler reported errors within these files:

  * src/lib.rs

This likely indicates a bug in either rustc or cargo itself,
and we would appreciate a bug report! You're likely to see
a number of compiler warnings after this message which cargo
attempted to fix but failed. If you could open an issue at
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues
quoting the full output of this command we'd be very appreciative!
Note that you may be able to make some more progress in the near-term
fixing code with the `--broken-code` flag

The following errors were reported:
error: variable 'rest' is still repeating at this depth
  --> src/lib.rs:15:18
